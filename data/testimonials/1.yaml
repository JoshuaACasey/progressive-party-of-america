text: "Particularly during the 2016 election, I came to the realization that the Democrats and Republicans simply do not care about us regular Americans. They care about rich people and their corporate donors. Our government is supposed to care about and work for ALL of us, not just some of us. Especially, as an autistic individual myself, the Democrats and Republicans do not care about those of us that are part of marginalized communities."
